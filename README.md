# Tom's Projects Page

This page holds current and completed projects from a variety of repositories. Due to the visibility of some repositories, not all source code is available but can be viewed through a selected hosting platform.

## Current Projects:

üìà CAI-Programming - Private Repo

The CAI-Programming repository includes coursework that I have completed over multiple semesters while pursuing a Bsc in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Technische Hoschule Ingolstadt. Assignments and Projects in Data Analytics, Web Design, Computer Vision, Neural Networks, Natural Language Modeling, and more is within this repository.

## Past Projects:

üìù[CozyStudy Site](https://cozystudy.vercel.app/) -  Private Repo

CozyStudy is a classic pomodoro timer with additional ambient noises, customizable settings, and clean UI. This app makes use of a React Frontend, Web Worker for preventing inactive tab timeout, and Tailwind CSS for a css styling framework. Improvements and bug fixes will be rolled out over the next few months.

‚òï[ToCan-Coffee Site](https://tocans.github.io/ToCan-Coffee/) - Hosted via GitHub Pages
</>[ToCan-Coffee Repo](https://github.com/ToCans/ToCan-Coffee/) - Public Repo

ToCan-Coffee was intended to provide a centralized location for those wanting to enter the world of coffee. The Site will at some point include information on coffee basics, recipes, brewing equipment, and tools but was used as a learning exercise for HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. The website may be updated and shifted into a full-stack application using better technologies, but it provided a great learning experience and shall remain that way for now.

</>[FCC-Projects Repo](https://github.com/ToCans/FCC-Projects) - Public Repo

FCC Projects is a repository that holds exercises and projects from FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/), [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/), [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), and [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) courses. These courses offer a great learning platform as I have completed the Python, Web Design, and Javascript classes, but I have since moved on to learning through personal projects instead of courses.
